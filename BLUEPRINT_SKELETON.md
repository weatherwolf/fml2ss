## Git Workflow Between Milestones


## Implementation Rules

- **One milestone per prompt**: Only implement one milestone at a time
- **Automatic git commands**: After each milestone, assistant provides git commands automatically
- **Wait for confirmation**: After each milestone, wait for user to run git commands before proceeding
- **Clear milestone boundaries**: Mark each milestone as completed before moving to the next

## File Editing Guidelines

- **Use targeted `search_replace`** for small changes instead of rewriting entire files
- **Avoid `edit_file` for minor updates** - it's inefficient and time-consuming
- **Use `search_replace`** for milestone status updates, adding new steps, or small modifications
- **Only use `edit_file`** when creating new files or making extensive structural changes
- **This applies to all blueprint files** - prioritize efficiency and speed

## Commit Message Format

Use this format for all commits in this implementation:
```
